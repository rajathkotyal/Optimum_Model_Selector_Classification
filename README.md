# Optimum_Model_Selector_Classification

Test out various classification models like SVM, GaussianNB, K-Nearest etc.. on your dataset by applying 
various hyper parameters in real time & choose the best model for your data.

## How to use :
1. Preprocess your dataset such that there are no missing values & no strings in the columns.
2. Label the output vector column as Outcome .i.e.

| X1 | X2 | X3 | ... | Xn | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  | | 0 |
|  |  |  |  |  | 1 |

3. Upload the dataset in CSV format.
4. Choose the desired model from the side bar, Tweak the hyper parameters, Choose the matric & click classify.
5. Analyse the graphs, select the model with the highest accuracy & precision.
6. Use the selected model to train your dataset in any app you are building as it will be the best fit for that particular dataset.
